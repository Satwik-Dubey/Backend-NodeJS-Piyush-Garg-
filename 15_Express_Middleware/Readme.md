## What is middleware?

Middleware is a function that runs between receiving a request from a client and sending a response from the server.

It acts as a gatekeeper or processor that:

Examines the request

Potentially modifies it

Decides whether to pass it forward, end the response, or block it

Important Notes:
If you donâ€™t call next(), the request will hang.

Middleware runs in the order it is defined.

Middleware can terminate the request (e.g., by sending a response early).



Basic Syntax 

```
app.use((req, res, next) => {
  console.log('Middleware called');
  next(); // Pass to the next middleware or route handler
});
```

If the current middleware is not functioning then it must call next middle ware otherwise request will be left hanging.
